    <h4 id="getOut"><i>Get out your seats, the show is over.</i> <br> BROCKHAMPTON 
      released its last albums as the group goes on a hiatus. However, fans
      speculate that the band is officially broken up for good. <br>
      This site outlines the band's music and celebrates the achievements of the band. <br>

      <h3>WHERE IT ALL STARTED</h3>
      <h4>Originally, BROCKHAMPTON was called ALIVESINCEFOREVER in 2009. 
        The band formed from a Kanye West forum after future BROCKHAMPTON leader, 
        Kevin Abstract, asked if anyone wanted to make a band. <br>
        After going from 30 to 14 members, the group changed their name to BROCKHAMPTON, the 
        name of the street Abstract grew up in located in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
        <br>
        The members of BROCKHAMPTON include those who deal with behind-the-scenes production and management;
        not all 14 members were performers. The original performing members include the following: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ian "Kevin Abstract" Simpson</li>
          <li>William "Merlyn" Wood</li>
          <li>Dominique "Dom McLennon" Simpson</li>
          <li>Matt Champion</li>
          <li>Russell "JOBA" Boring</li>
          <li>Ciaran "bearface" McDonald</li>
          <li>Ameer Vann (former member)</li>

  <!--AAT-->
  <div class="alb">
    <div class="alb-copy">
    <h5>ALL-AMERICAN TRASH (2016)</h5>
    <h4 id="album-copy">
      As the first album released, AAT is experimental and is sometimes considered to be a 
      mixtape rather than an album. Typically the least favorite album of fans,
      AAT isn't as developed as other BH releases and the tracks are short in comparison to other works released.
      One track 'FLIP MO' is joked as being BH's best song by fans due to how bad the track is. However, a few memorable tracks are 
      'BEN CARSON' and 'MICHIGAN.'

  <!--SATURATION (I, II, III)-->
  <div class="multi">
    <h5 id="sat-title">SATURATION I, II, III (2017)</h5> 
    <h4 id="sat-sub">The SATURATION series was released in 2017, BROCKHAMPTON aiming to saturate the market with their music.</h4>
    <br>
    <div class="sat-1">
    <img src="sat1.jpg" alt="SATURATION I album">
    <h4 id="sat1-copy"> SATURATION <br>
      Using some of the sound they created in AAT, SATURATION I is a fan favorite, and includes some of the band's best tracks.
      The album features a variety of fast songs with loud bass, but also includes a few slower tracks. 
      Almost all the songs are fan favorites but the most memorable are 'GOLD,' 'STAR,' and 'FACE.' </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="sat-2">
    <img src="sat2.jpg" id="sat-2" alt="SATURATION II album">
    <h4 id="sat2-copy"> SATURATION II <br>
    Continuing the SATURATION series, this album is another favorite of the fans. One in particular, 'FIGHT'
    sticks out as members Ameer and Dom discuss their experiences of growing up black in America and how their skin color
    affects mamy aspects of their lives. Additionally, 'JUNKY' is another track that discusses tough topics, such as homophobia, drug abuse, suicidal thoughts,
    and sexism. By rapping about relevant social topics, BH made a mark in the rap industry with these tracks.</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="sat-3">
    <img src="sat3.png" id="sat-3" alt="SATURATION III album">
    <h4 id="sat3-copy"> SATURATION III <br>
      As the final installment in the SATURATION series, SATURATION III features arguably BROCKHAMPTON's most popular track: 'BLEACH.'
      With a total of over 200,000,000 listens on Spotify, the song allows members to rap about their internal struggles and wipe them away with bleach. Being their most popular song,
      it's clear that with its meaningful lyrics, 'BLEACH' is a representation on what makes BROCKHAMPTON special.</h4>

  <!--IRIDESCENCE-->
  <div class="alb">
    <div class="alb-copy">
    <h5>iridescence (2018)</h5>
    <h4>Often not favorited by fans, iridescence is the album that was released after Ameer Vann's departure from the group.
      While the group went through the turmoil of losing an important member, the feedback of iridescence reflects the difficult time the band went through. Vann, accused of emotional
      and sexual abuse and sexual misconduct with minors, was exposed on Twitter. While he did apologize for his actions, he eventually left the group.<br><br>
      Iridescence, while sometimes not being as liked as the SATURATION series, includes a few gems, one being 'DISTRICT.' The track discusses the role materialism plays in the group after their rise to fame
      after releasing the SATURATION series and also discusses topics such as depression, loneliness, and paranoia.

  <!--GINGER-->
  <div class="alb">
    <div class="alb-copy">
    <h5>GINGER (2019)</h5>
    <h4>The release of GINGER features another one of the band's most famous tracks: 'SUGAR.' After getting famous on TikTok, the track exposed the group to a larger
      audience. On Spotify, it's BH's most played song, reaching over 400,000,000 listens. <br><br>
      Besides 'SUGAR,' the album uses religion as a metaphor, as seen with titles 'NO HALO,' 'HEAVEN BELONGS TO YOU,' and 'IF YOU PRAY RIGHT.' Member Joba raps about his experience with faith
      and the album represents the band's recovery after the departure of Ameer. One track, 'DEARLY DEPARTED' features the band's thoughts on Ameer and his departure.

    <h5>ROADRUNNER: NEW LIGHT, NEW MACHINE (2019)</h5>
    <h4>ROADRUNNER has many features of other artists, giving the tracks variety. Two notable tracks include 'THE LIGHT' and 'THE LIGHT PT. II' which
      showcases Joba reflecting on his father's suicide and how its affected him. Tackling these difficult topics, fans showed support to the member through online communities.

      <img src="tf.jpg" alt="TF album">
      <h4 id="tf-copy">The Family<br>
        As one of the last BH albums, The Family is problematic as it only features leader Kevin Abstract and no other members. However, the album shares the falling out 
      that the band experienced and how Abstract wasn't able to keep the band together in the end. One notable track is 'Brockhampton' which is Abstract's farewell to the band.
      The intro to the track features a clip of an Instagram live from 2019 where the band walked through the McDonald's drive through after performing a show. Serving as the finale to the album and the band, 
    the track is bittersweet as Abstract recounts the good memories and talents of the other members.</h4>

      <img src="tm.png" id="tm" alt="TM album">
      <h4 id="tm-copy"> TM <br>
        TM was a bonus final album released by the band featuring all of its members. At their final performance at the Fonda, Merlyn spoiled to the fans that TM stands for 
      "the mountain." 'NEW SHOES' received a music video and gave fans one last taste of the band being together. The final track 'GOODBYE' serves as all the members' last words and thoughts on being part of BROCKHAMPTON. </h4>

<!--THE FALL-->
<section id="fall"></section>
<div class="fall">
  <div id="fall-text">
  <h3>THE FALL OF BROCKHAMPTON</h3>
  <h4>BROCKHAMPTON started to decline in 2018 after member Ameer Vann
    received allegations of emotional and sexual abuse, leading to his dismissal from the group.
    At the time, the band had continuously teased their album formally known as <i>PUPPY</i>, which ended up
    getting scrapped due to Vann leaving the group.</h4>
  <h4>Also in 2018, the band signed with the record label RCA, and in <i>The Family</i>, Kevin Abstract
  shares how the album was made "to get out the deal" and how the boys "sign[ed] for too many
  motherf***in' deals." In their contract with RCA, BROCKHAMPTON was required to release
  six albums.</h4>
  <h4>Like many boybands, it's common for them to breakup, but fans were surprised to hear
    BROCKHAMPTON was cancelling their entire US and part of their Europe tour, going on an "indefinite hiatus" with their last performances
    being London and Coachella 2022.

  <h3 id="m-title">MEANING</h3>
  <h4>As someone who has been a fan since the release of GINGER, I can say that the band breaking up is tragic but not suprising. It's common to see bands 
    drive apart and work on their own personal careers. However, like other fans, BH has helped me during hard times and they have such a special and unique sound it's sad to see them go.
    Although the members may release their own individual music, it won't be the same, however we can appreciate the impact BH has made in the time that they were a group.</h4>
