    <p id="ballad-p">"It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. 
        In the Capital, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in 
        the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus 
        will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute. <br><br>
        The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from 
        District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined -- every choice Coriolanus makes could 
        lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... 
        and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes."</p>

    <h2 id="ballad-title">THE HUNGER GAMES</h2>
    <p id="thg-p">Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem, 
        the remains of what used be North America. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of 
        the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, 
        "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go in her place. (Scholastic Press, 2008)</p>

    <p id="thg-p">Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her more 
        is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the 
        Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their 
        love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying. (Scholastic Press, 2009)</p>
